				Hello! I am Apurva. I completed my graduation in Financial Markets from <br>University of Mumbai and shorty after that I was working as a Product <br>Executive in a brokerage firm named Sharekhan Ltd. I used to handle their <br>website. While working there I got introduced to User interface and User experience<br> and I found it interesting. When I was in college I was thinking about creating my own <br>blog, so I started researching about how I can create a website. While doing my <br>research I realised that there are so many things to web development and each <br>aspect of web development was very fascinating for me. Unfortunately, I couldn’t<br> find a niche for the blog at that time and I didn’t create my blog. But I wanted to <br>learn more about web development and UI/UX therefore I started searching what<br> programs are available for it. I came across the program of Interactive Media Management. <br>As I don’t have any prior education in the field of media, I am creating this portfolio so I can apply <br>for the course.I hope you like the website!
